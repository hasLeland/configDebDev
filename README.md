Configuration Files
===================

This is my unified set of configuration files that I use for my Debian-based development environment.

Prerequisites
-------------

	1. For use with Xmonad and xmobar
	2. Assumes that Xmonad and xmobar are already installed.
	3. Xmobar has to be installed via Cabal, and located in the ~/.cabal/bin directory

This is pretty much it. Simply run the "installConfig.sh" script to install. Be aware, this will copy over all existing files without double checking.
