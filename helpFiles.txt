#### How to reconnect to an interupted screen session. Useful for when a terminal quits on you. ####
	- use "screen -D" to force a disconnect, then reconnect normally (using "screen -r")

#### Alternate way to add network interfaces for Ubuntu ####
There is some kind of bug in Ubuntu, you can't add interfaces very well. To add and interface, use this command:
	sudo ifconfig eth0:0 199.21.222.23 netmask 255.255.255.240 up

substitute different values as needed, but that is the basic way it should go.

#### Connecting to the RaspberyPi with RaspBMC installed ####
Connection details:
	username : pi
	password : raspberry

Use "nmap -sP '192.168.2.*'" to find it in the group of IP's.
Even better, use "nmap 192.168.2.1-254" to scan all ports on all ip addresses.

#### Installing Easy_Install with Python3 on Ubuntu ####
Run "sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools"
From there, you can install Pip with:
	"python3 -m easy_install pip"

#### Installing Xmobar with DWM on Ubuntu Server ####
Installing Xmobar normally seems to fail with the error: 

	checking for X11/extensions/Xinerama.h... yes
	checking X11/extensions/Xrandr.h usability... no
	checking X11/extensions/Xrandr.h presence... no
	checking for X11/extensions/Xrandr.h... no
	configure: error: X11/extensions/Xrandr.h (from libXrandr) is required
	cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
	X11-1.6.0.2 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
	ExitFailure 1
	xmobar-0.15 depends on X11-1.6.0.2 which failed to install.

The problem is that there aren't certain Xrandr development files installed. To resolve this, run:
	"sudo apt-get install libxrandr-dev"

This will install the appropriate files for Xmobar to be installed.

#### Using Irssi Linux IRC Client ####
Irssi operates in a way similar to screen/xmonad in that it creates many virtual "windows" to manage things. Additionally, the switching of windows is done using a "modkey" (is generally ALT, although the ESC key will also always work).
	A great guide on using IRSSI can be found at http://carina.org.uk/screenirssi.shtml
The following is a list of commands and tips for using IRSSI:
	- To join a channel, use the command "/j #<channelname>" (the # is important!)
	- The modkey is either the ALT key or the ESC key. I use ESC because ALT is used for Xmonad.
	- To switch between windows, press the modkey and the number of the window you want to switch to.
