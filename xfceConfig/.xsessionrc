# This is here to wait for all the proper graphical things to be setup before
# it launches xmonad to replace the window manager.
#
# It's actually quite important that this wait to happen, since launching it
# prior to the full startup of the existing window manager will cause problems.
# For example, if xmonad is lanched prior to, or during the startup of, the
# default XFCE window manager, then the GTK window styles will not be applied.
# Additionally, custom keyboard commands won't be loaded, which in my case
# disables me from launching `dmenu` with "ctrl+alt+p"
#
# The reason this is here and not in the XFCE startup configuration like most
# people recommend is because I've found the XFCE statup configurator to be
# rather unreliable in when it launches things. On my laptop initializing
# xmonad via the XFCE statup config works just fine, but on my desktop I had to
# resort to this hack to get things working.
#
# On a different note, at some time in the future I may adapt this so that I
# can load larger custom scripts consistently after the entire desktop is
# setup.
